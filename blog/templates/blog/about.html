            Welcome to <strong>The Blog Who Lived</strong> — a developer’s journal built on code, caffeine, and second
            chances.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>The Blog Who Lived</strong> isn’t just a blog — it’s a space for stories that deserve to be heard.
            Whether it’s code you wrote, a memory you carry, a lesson life taught you, or something the world needs to know —
            this is where it lives.
        </p>
        <p>
            The name? It’s a quiet rebellion — against fear, delay, and doubt. This blog lived through it all.
            Yeah, you guessed it — a Harry Potter fanboy. </p>
        <p>
            So write that post. About your first project. Or your worst heartbreak. Or your favorite food.
            If it mattered to you, it belongs here. You matter. Your story matters. We're listening.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whether you're here to learn, write, or just scroll — thanks for stopping by.
        </p>
